# Real-Time Personalized Health Advisory System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a **Real-Time Personalized Health Advisory System** using Pathway's powerful streaming data processing framework. The system ingests real-time health data, integrates it with relevant external knowledge using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and provides personalized health recommendations. The project showcases the potential of AI in proactive healthcare by processing data from wearables, fitness trackers, and clinical records.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Continuously processes health data from multiple sources.
- **Intelligent Health Recommendations**: Provides personalized advice based on health data and external guidelines.
- **RAG Integration**: Retrieves up-to-date health guidelines and recommendations using Pathway's RAG pipeline.
- **User Interface**: A dynamic dashboard (built with Streamlit or Gradio) that updates as new data is processed.

## Technologies Used
- **Pathway**: A high-performance data processing framework for real-time data streaming.
- **Python**: Programming language for building the system.
- **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge.
- **Streamlit/Gradio**: Frameworks for building the user interface.
- **APIs**: Integration with external APIs like weather (OpenWeatherMap) and air quality (IQAir) for contextual recommendations.
